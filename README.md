## History

The font was originally designed by Vlad Dorosh as Oglavie UCS for
the [Irmologion project](http://irmologion.ru/fonts.html#Oglavie).
It was then released under the LaTeX Project Public License
as part of [CSLTeX](https://sites.google.com/site/csltex/).
Next, it was reencoded for Unicode by Aleksandr Andreev as Oglavie Unicode, part of the
[Slavonic Computing Initiative](https://sci.ponomar.net/fonts.html), and released under SIL OFL v. 1.1.
Edited by Aleksandr Andreev.

## Building the Fonts

The font is built using fontmake and gftools post processing script. Tools are all python based, so it must be previously installed.

To install all the Python tools into a virtualenv, do the following:

From terminal:

```

cd your/local/project/directory

#once in the project folder create a virtual environment. 
This step has to be done just once, the first time:

python3 -m venv venv

#activate the virtual environment

source venv/bin/activate

#install the required dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Then run the this command:

```
cd sources
gftools builder config.yaml
```

The fonts are supposed to build automatically in the repository 
using GitHub Actions, but this does not work correctly 
for some reason.

## Features

There are no specialized features. Only glyphs used in titling are provided in the font.
